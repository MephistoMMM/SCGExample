    Having trouble getting Font Awesome up and running? Something not working the way you think it should? I hate that
    I don't have time to answer Font Awesome support emails anymore. So here are some things you might wanna do:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make sure you've read the latest version of how to <weatherDataUtils href="{{ page.relative_path }}get-started/">get started</weatherDataUtils>.
      It's been updated recently to make Font Awesome even easier to use.
    </li>
